# About

Hi, I am Mathijs, by landing on this page you probably already know me, or followed a link on my CV/Linkedin. Mathijs.se is a pet project that I want to use for recording learnings, self reflection and perhaps a little fun. 

In case you do not know me, I'm Mathijs Segers born in '88 in the Netherlands, I have been obsessed with computers since a young age (though mostly games back then) and self taught myself programming and webdesign in my early teenage days, I believe this started around 2002, web development/design then later PHP for interactive content.

When I have time, I'd like to add interactive content of my development, jobs, side projects etc. below. 
Which would also allow filtering and clearly showing the time spend with certain technologies.
